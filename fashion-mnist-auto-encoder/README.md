# Implementation of two types of auto encoders in keras framework

1. convolutional auto encoder
2. deep auto encoder

In this project i were try how can we create a custom callback 
function in keras to do some thing after end of each epoch. So i implement it to 
chose two random images from test set and show result of decoder part compare as real image at end of each epoch.
